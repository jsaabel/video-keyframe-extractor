# Video Keyframe Extractor

### Description

Quick and dirty fork of [01-DC's original repo](https://github.com/01-DC/video-keyframe-extractor). 
Added some code to help crawl a provided website (with subpages) for video links and download those,
then perform the extraction process on all downloaded videos. Also added zfill to the extractor-script
to fix a minor problem with file ordering.
